# PROTOTYPES
This folder contains the concise documentation for different prototypes that I developed throughout my research. Further information on each prototype including their design and build can be found in each respective folder.

## Prototype 1: Basic Beam Break Sensor
This was the first prototype and is enabled through the Arduino's built in Tone() function. The code is straightforward, sending a 38kHz tone from an IR LED to a TSOP38230 IR Reciever, detecting when the signal is broken, and printing a message through a serial connection to acknowledge the break. In this prototype, the arduino is both sending, and recieving the signal.

### Materials
- Arduino Wifi Rev 2 (can be substituted for an Arduino Uno)
- IR LED x1
- TSOP38230 38kHz IR receiver x1
- 10k resistor x1
- Lead cables
- Small breadboard x1

## Prototype 2: 555 Timer Beam-Break
This prototype is enabled by a 555 timer. The processing within this intelligent piece of hardware uses the resistance and capacitance of its circuit to determine the frequency which to light the LED. The reciever in this prototype has remained the same but is now connected to a nodeMCU ESP8266, while the 555 timer circuit is being run from a usb power cable.

## Prototype 3: Veroboard Beam-Break
This prototype replicates prototype 2 but in a sturdier form, exchanging the breadboard for a solderable veroboard - in this case, the electrcookie solderable breadboard and a piece of miscallaneous stripboard. This will allow for a stable and reliable deployment in order to capture data while prototype 4 is in development. The timer circuit is now powered by a 9V battery, and the reciever circuit continues to be attached to and powered by the nodeMCU ESP8266. As this is the first deployed prototyep, this was the first to contain two separate LED-receiver pairs. A paired approached allows for the determination of movement direction with the system.
