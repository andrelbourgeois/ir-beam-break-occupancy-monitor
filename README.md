## About

Occupancy Monitoring System for Smart Buildings
Welcome to the GitHub repository for our project focused on developing an innovative occupancy monitoring solution for smart buildings. In an era characterized by data-driven decision-making and evolving work environments, the need for adaptable and flexible building systems has never been more pronounced. Our project addresses this need by introducing an infrared beam-break approach to occupancy monitoring, aiming to optimize resource utilization, reduce costs, and minimize carbon emissions associated with building operations.

Abstract
In today's dynamic world, where the nature of workspaces is shifting and traditional building roles are being redefined, it becomes imperative that our physical environment is equally adaptable. This project delves into the realm of occupancy monitoring, a critical area of research that holds the potential to significantly mitigate financial, resource, and environmental impacts associated with building operations.

Our research an approach to occupancy monitoring using infrared beam-break technology within the context of smart buildings. The goal was to achieve a level of accuracy comparable to existing commercial solutions. We adopted an iterative design, build, and critique methodology, continually testing and refining various components including the codebase, circuitry, enclosure design, and deployment strategies.

The resultant system, when operating under optimal and controlled conditions, successfully demonstrates the ability to monitor space occupancy with a degree of accuracy similar to that of prevalent commercial alternatives. However, acknowledging the real-world challenges and the rigorous testing that incumbent solutions have undergone, it becomes evident that our proposed system falls short of the initial goal set forth in this study.

While the current implementation might not meet all the desired criteria, the concept of utilizing beam-break sensors for occupancy monitoring remains a promising avenue. Future exploration should focus on microcontrollers capable of supporting multithreading, thereby enabling concurrent monitoring of multiple beam-break pairs, executing complex calculations, and transmitting telemetry seamlessly. We believe this direction holds the key to unlocking the full potential of our system within the existing technological landscape.
